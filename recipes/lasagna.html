    <h2>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</h2>
    <p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how 
      successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more 
      than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two 
      decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old.
